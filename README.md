# Opportunity atlas project 

This project combines the [Opportunity Atlas dataset](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) with [FacDB neighborhood] (http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/) and [ACS rent] (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) data to identify how NYC neighborhoods shape children's opportunities and how children's opportunities shape their neighborhoods.
