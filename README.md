# Opportunity atlas project 

This project combines the [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) dataset with [FacDB neighborhood](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/) and [ACS rent](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) data to identify how NYC neighborhoods shape children's opportunities and how children's opportunities shape their neighborhoods. 

Note that Figure 1 is not displayed as github .md files do not support interactive maps. Please visit [here](http://rpubs.com/lllhrvth/op_atlas_project) to view the opportunity data mapped onto New York city census tracts.
